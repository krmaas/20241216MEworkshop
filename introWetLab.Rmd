# What's next?

More data! Or less?

- v4 sequencing dictated by Illumina technology, not superiority of v4 alone
- Single variable region often only gives genus level resolution
- Full 16S usually gives species, sometimes subspecies

- ![Long Reads](Nanopore-sequencing.jpg){width=80%}

- ** Tens of thousands of short reads < Fewer long reads **
- *** As long as the quality of the long reads is g'nuff ***
